# May 1st: Started workshop and schematic

We started the workshop following Cherry's (club leader) tutorial on the workshop. We started the schematic for the project. 

**Total time spent: 1h**

# May 8th: Converted everything in PCB format and started wiring

On this meeting we started to wire the different components of our card and placing the pieces in different areas

**Total time spent: 1h**

# May 15th: Started to decorate

We converted installed an SVG downloader extension because at the time we didn't know how to add files at the time so we downloaded an extension off of github that would allow us to download SVG images. Then we started finding images to download. I was stumped and just started by looking at a bunch of images on an SVG website.

**Total time spent: 1h**

# May 22th: More decorating

I just kept decorating this whole meeting. I had to tap into what I really like because I find it hard to summarize my personality into just one thing. After staring at pinterest for way too long I got the idea for the fish. For my name I downloaded more fonts to make my name on the PCB. after tampering with the fonts a bit I finally found a font that worked for my style. I started working on it at home because I found that I didn't have enough time to do it at the club.

**Total time spent: 1.5h**

# June 5th: Finishing touches and rewiring

I made some finishing touches to the design before I started to work on rewiring it. My club leader took a look at my wiring and told me that some of the angles needed to be fixed. So we worked on fixing the wiring and just overall making it neater. I started a bit of the ordering process by the end.

**Total time spent: 1h**

# June 7th: Ordering process and applications

We had to do an extra meeting to cover the ordering process. I finished everything that I needed to do on JLCPCB and put it in my cart. Before this we were applying for a different grant, but we applied too late and every spot had already been filled up.

**Total time spent: 1h**
